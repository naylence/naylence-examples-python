# Advanced Security ‚Äî Strict Overlay (BSL)

This example shows Naylence running in its **strictest security mode**:
agents join the fabric only after passing through a full **admission + identity** flow,
with **SPIFFE/X.509 workload certificates** and **sealed overlay encryption**.

---

## Why this matters

* **Agent node identities** are cryptographic, short-lived, and automatically issued.
* **Admission service** decides *where* each agent node belongs and issues scoped attach tickets.
* **Certificates** encode the agent‚Äôs physical path in the fabric.
* **Parent sentinels**¬†validate both the attach ticket *and* the cert before finalizing the attach.
* **Overlay encryption** ensures agent-to-agent  confidentiality and authenticity across hops.

This is the **enterprise zero-trust profile** of Naylence, available under the **BSL license**.
The open-source core already provides strong EdDSA-based overlay signing ‚Äî this example
adds a federated identity and admission layer for cross-org and regulated deployments.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This example requires the `naylence-advanced-security` package and the
> corresponding Docker image (`naylence/agent-sdk-adv-python`). These components
> are licensed under the **BSL**.

## Quick start

> Requirements: Docker + Docker Compose installed.

From this example folder:

```bash
make start       # üîê generates PKI + dev secrets, then brings up the stack (caddy, oauth2, welcome, ca, sentinel, math-agent)
```

Run the sample client against the math agent (add/multiply/fib\_stream):

```bash
make run         # ‚ñ∂Ô∏è executes client.py inside the example network
```

Shut down and clean up:

```bash
make stop        # ‚èπ stop containers
make clean       # üßπ remove generated .env files, PKI dir, caddy data, secrets
```

### See encryption in action

Use the verbose target to print every **envelope** as it travels through the fabric:

```bash
make run-verbose
```

You‚Äôll see signed and (when enabled) sealed envelopes printed to stdout, which is a handy way to verify overlay security end‚Äëto‚Äëend.

## What happens under the hood

1. **JWT** ‚Äî The client/agent obtains a token from the OAuth2 dev server.
2. **Welcome** ‚Äî Admission validates the token, issues:

   * Placement (which parent to attach to)
   * Attach ticket (short-lived capability)
3. **CA** ‚Äî Agent node requests a SPIFFE/X.509 cert bound to its placement.
4. **Attach** ‚Äî Agent node connects via TLS/WSS to the parent sentinel, presents:

   * Attach JWT ticket (authorization)
   * SPIFFE cert (identity + path binding)
5. **Validation** ‚Äî Parent sentinel checks ticket *then* cert.
6. **Ack** ‚Äî On success, overlay encryption and message signing are enabled with the agent‚Äôs identity.

All of this is **fully automated** in this example.

---

## Certificate lifecycle

There is no background ‚Äúrotation.‚Äù
All SPIFFE/X.509 certs are **short‚Äëlived** (e.g., 24h).
When one expires, the agent repeats the Admission + CA flow to obtain a fresh cert.

---

## Sample envelope (verbose mode)

A **data frame** envelope printed by `make run-verbose` might look like this:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "id": "mu2l8LmB6bvJAiL",
  "sid": "6KbaPqxYq8p3hjDaUw3YBH",
  "traceId": "Or9bha2d6tDb2yC",
  "to": "math@fame.fabric",
  "replyTo": "rpc-N7GImNdeVMvRMQo@/Cb8WVCC4ML5RsFM/9gxwoGeeBBSR3Oh",
  "rtype": 2,
  "corrId": "3f1kkiuHVcbiTT3",
  "seqId": 0,
  "flowFlags": 0,
  "frame": {
    "type": "Data",
    "codec": "b64",
    "payload": "wOigrL848iSgv8qfUdntQTwMzEVRYBSTQLqY7Vwui7lJMHm2Akuze3gL5jBH0GKqw99canUn1EsrA6vss51OGgFyDTLbwz5rljcATB9TA8X7wERTvtUa8QWsaMfC5LFYJuc/nZsRqX7pZAXC3FWFvgwAUw==",
    "pd": "4Fg9MfgDCY09YqN0ep7Ntx"
  },
  "ts": "2025-08-29T23:56:10.366Z",
  "sec": {
    "sig": {
      "kid": "xAhddeRwu2UvuJr",
      "val": "IyaOG4hMLuafFAv8Sd77HUb1PhKobN0lCOOu7Qpa-y59QFH_3BMO98OPbKalzoKoJEsH9tkJimA9P7c4YQ2LDA"
    },
    "enc": {
      "alg": "chacha20-poly1305-channel",
      "kid": "auto-math@fame.fabric-7snnHCFG1FA5UGV",

    }
  }
}
```

### What to look for (high‚Äëlevel)

* `id`, `seqId`, `traceId`, `corrId`, `flowId` ‚Äî delivery and tracing metadata.
* `to` ‚Äî fabric destination (agent address).
* `frame` ‚Äî the **content**: here a `Data` frame with base64 payload and optional per‚Äëframe metadata `pd`.
* `ts` ‚Äî send timestamp.
* `sec.sig` ‚Äî **envelope signature** (EdDSA) with key id `kid`; guarantees integrity and authenticity end‚Äëto‚Äëend.
* `sec.enc` ‚Äî **overlay encryption** details when sealing is on (algorithm, sender key id, short auth tag / nonce material). Confirms confidentiality on top of channel TLS.
* `payload`¬†‚Äî **encrypted data payload**

In strict overlay, parents validate the **attach ticket**, then the **SPIFFE/X.509 cert** (including placement binding). After ack, sealed channels use these identities for authenticated encryption across hops.

## Notes

* This demo uses a **dev OAuth2 server** and Caddy TLS termination for convenience.
* Do **not** use this setup in production; integrate with your real IdP and secure CA.
* Example is provided for evaluation; production onboarding requires professional services.
