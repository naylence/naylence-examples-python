# Hello Example

This example demonstrates the **simplest distributed setup** using the Naylence Agent SDK. It consists of two components:

* **EchoAgent** — a minimal agent that simply echoes back any payload it receives.
* **Client** — a short‑lived program that sends a message to the agent and prints the response.

In this demo, the agent is hosted directly on a **sentinel node**, and the client connects directly to it. In real production setups, agents usually run behind sentinels, and clients don’t talk to agents directly — but for simplicity, we bend the rules here.

> ⚠️ **Security note:** This example does **not** feature any security mechanisms. It is kept intentionally minimal for learning purposes. Later examples in this repository will introduce secure configurations.

## Components

### EchoAgent

* Implemented in [`echo_agent.py`](echo_agent.py).
* Extends `BaseAgent` from the Naylence Agent SDK — the simplest way to build a new agent.
* Overrides `run_task` (fully async), which can support long‑running tasks.
* Assigned a **logical address** (`echo@fame.fabric`) defined in [`common.py`](common.py), so other components can reference it.

### Client

* Implemented in [`client.py`](client.py).
* Creates a remote handle to the agent by its logical address.
* Sends the string `"Hello, World!"` as a task.
* Prints the agent’s echoed response.

Expected output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Running the Example

There are two ways to run the components:

### 1. Standalone Python

Make sure your Python environment is set up (the project includes a `pyproject.toml`).

Start the agent (long‑running service):

```bash
python echo_agent.py
```

In another terminal, run the client:

```bash
export FAME_DIRECT_ADMISSION_URL="ws://localhost:8000/fame/v1/attach/ws/downstream"
python client.py
```

---

### 2. Docker Compose

Start the echo agent via Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:

* A sentinel on `localhost:8000`
* The `echo-agent` connected to that sentinel

Run the client locally:

```bash
export FAME_DIRECT_ADMISSION_URL="ws://localhost:8000/fame/v1/attach/ws/downstream"
python client.py
```

Stop services when done:

```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

Optionally, run the client inside Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD:/work:ro" -w /work \
  --network "$(basename "$PWD")_naylence-net" \
  -e FAME_DIRECT_ADMISSION_URL="ws://echo-agent:8000/fame/v1/attach/ws/downstream" \
  naylence/agent-sdk-python \
  python client.py
```

---

## Notes

* Agents are typically **long‑running services** (run via Compose).
* Clients are typically **short‑lived** and run on demand (for faster iteration).
* In Compose networking, use `echo-agent:8000`; from your host, use `localhost:8000`.

This example is intentionally minimal — a first step toward building more complex and **secure** multi‑agent distributed systems with Naylence.
